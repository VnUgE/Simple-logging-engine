# Simple-logging-engine
Logging engine that takes cli arguments to write log files.

Creates a "Log.txt" file wherever you tell it to with date and time entries with custom messages. Everything is handled through the command line so it can be implemented into any existing project to simply write log txt files. 

Roadmap:
   Directive expansion and feature expansion
   
Try one of the the following commands.

write - write command to log file
 Syntax: write path:c:\ "message"

start - start a new log (clean old log file if there is one) 
 Syntax: start path:c:\

clean - delete old log and log direcotries
 Syntax: clean path:c:\

Thats it for now!
